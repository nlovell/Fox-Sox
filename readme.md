# Fox Sox
Have you ever wished your Minecraft Foxes had better footwear? Do you think your orange fluffy friends need to stay warm in the virtual world of Minecraft? Are you a degenerate who wants to see cuboid canidae with colourful [Programming Socks](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/584/957/ea7.png)?

Well, this vanilla-style texture addon does exactly what it says on the tin - it adds Soxes to your Foxes.

Version: 0.1
Author: Alan Lovell
Source: nlovell.dev/Fox-Sox

Compatible with every version of Minecraft that has foxes, so far.
Tested on 1.14.2

## How to use

Download this repository as a .zip (click [here](https://github.com/nlovell/Fox-Sox/archive/master.zip)), then add it to your ``.minecraft\resources`` folder.  
If you don't have Optifine installed, feel free to unzip this pack, then move the desired fox/fox-sleep images out of ``foxsox\assets\minecraft\optifine\random\entity\fox`` and into ``foxsox\assets\minecraft\textures\entity\fox``.
If you do have Optifine installed, the foxes will spawn with random sock textures. Neat, huh?

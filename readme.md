## How to use

Download this repository as a .zip (click [here](https://github.com/nlovell/Fox-Sox/archive/master.zip)), then add it to your ``.minecraft\resources`` folder.  
If you don't have Optifine installed, feel free to unzip this pack, then move the desired fox/fox-sleep images out of ``foxsox\assets\minecraft\optifine\random\entity\fox`` and into ``foxsox\assets\minecraft\textures\entity\fox``.
If you do have Optifine installed, the foxes will spawn with random sock textures. Neat, huh?
